# About Me

<br>
.font140[
- Long time aspiration to contribute to bringing more empirical rigor to policy discussions
  - Admire academic pursuit of rigor and global scope of the endeavor
  - Not so interested in novelty, struggle with academic contempt towards policy analysis
  - Admire relevancy of policy analysis, but struggle with lack of rigor
- Work as a policy economist for 4 years in Chile (Poverty, Education)
- Migrated to the US for family reasons 8 years ago

# About You
<br>
.font140[
- In one word: which area do you work on? 
   - Example: health, poverty, labor, energy, etc.
- What policy issue has occupied most of your time lately? 
   - Example: identifying vulnerable populations, providing essential goods or services, building infraestructure, etc.
- What type of analysis did you used, or would have liked to use, to inform the previous policy issue?
   - Example: geografical estimates of poverty, accurate costs of provision of goods and services, context relevant cost-benefits analysis.

name: motivation

# .font80[Policy Analysis And The Evidence-Based Policy Movement]
.font130[
Evidence-Based movement is growing.  
- The golden age of evidence-based policy (Haskins 2017).  
- Credible causal evidence (Angrist & Pischke, 2010).  
- Transparency and reproducibility of research (Miguel et al. 2014).  
- Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking (CEBP, 2017)  
]
--

.font130[
Policy Analysis is a fundamental link. 
- As many definitions as textbooks (Dunn, 2015; Weimer & Vining, 2017; Williams, 1971)  
- Common denominator: client-oriented empirical analysis meant to inform a specific policy debate  
- Aspires at scientific rigor. (Wildavsky 1979),

# Reproducibility Crisis In Empirical Research     

.font140[
<br>
- Large magnitude of publication bias (Franco et al 2014).  
]
--
.font140[
- Evidence of extensive p-hacking across social science disciplines (Gerber et al 2008, Brodeur et al 2016).  
]
--
.font140[
- Replication rates are low (Collaboration et al, 2015 , Camerer et al, 2016, 2018).  
]
--
.font140[
- Computational reproducibility is also low (Stodden et al 2016, Chang and Li 2015, Gertler et al 2018).

# The Open Science Movement    

.font140[
<br>
- Definition of principles of Open Science/Research Transparency (Miguel et al 2014)
]
--
.font140[
- Development of guidelines to operationalize principles of Open Science (Nosek et al 2015)
]

.font140[
- Journals and funders: Journals (Science + 5k other journals), Registries (AEA), Funders (NIH, NSF and multiple donors)

Main consequences of policy analysis that lacks openness:


- 1 - Cherry picking evidence.

.font140[
- 2 - Challenging to automate and improve systematically recurring reports.

- 3 - Difficulty understanding how research informs policy analysis.

# Cherry Picking Evidence
<br>
.font150[
    <blockquote>
    “When I was director of the CBO, I was very frustrated when we would write a policy report [saying] a certain policy would have these two advantages and these two disadvantages, and the advocates would quote only the part about the advantages, and the opponents would quote only the part about the disadvantages. That encourages the view that there are simple answers. There aren’t generally simple answers. There are trade-offs.”

]
---
# Our Plan for OPA
<br>
.font140[
- Develop framework to support OPA

# Open Discussion

<br>

.font140[
- Who are the key providers of policy analysis in your country? 

- Is there an example of a previous analysis that you think could have benefited from the OPA framework?

- Can you think of a topic in the near future (up to 2 years) where a policy analysis will be generated and might benefit from the OPA framework?
